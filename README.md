### D3 challenge Homework - Data-Driven Documents 

### U. Richmond Data Analytics Bootcamp (November, 2019)

> D3.js is a JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data 
> visualizations in web browsers. It makes use of the widely implemented Scalable
> Vector Graphics, HTML5, and Cascading Style Sheets standards.

> In this assignment, we use D3 to complete a data journalism assignment by analyzing
> health trends regarding obesity, smoking, and lack of health care as functions
> of age, poverty rates, and income levels on a state-by-state basis.
> The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 American Community
> Survey 1-year estimates.

> Required output:
    * Scatterplot between two variables where data points are shown as circles
    with state names inside the circles, axes labeled
> Optional output:
    * Create dynamic scatterplot with selectable variables on each axis
    * Incorporate d3 "tool tip" to reveal a specific element's data when the user hovers their cursor over the element
    * Circles were color coded by US region to highlight geographic differences

* Observation 1: Increased poverty is associated with greater levels ofobesity and smoking with reduced health care

* Observation 2: Obesity is not correlated with age. Younger people also are less likely to smoke and have more health coverage

* Observation 3: Income seems to be the determining factor with respect to reduced levels of obesity, less smoking, and better healthcare.

* Observation 4: Regional differences are clear with the Southern and Southwestern states having greater poverty, lower health care coverage, higher rates of smoking and obesity.  The impact of greater income in Maryland, Delaware, and Virginia offsets the regional bias.
